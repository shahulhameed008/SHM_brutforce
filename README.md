# Brute-Force Attack
**Description:**  brute-force is an uninformed type of attack where you randomly generate payload to bypass a security system. This here is a python code implementing a brute-force attack, which takes a username and a list of passwords, then iterates through it until the correct passeord is found.

## Prerequisites :
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install with `pip install requests`)

## Usage:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:

  ```python
  pip install requests
  ```
3. Create a text file "pasword.txt" which contains only one password per line.
4. Run the script using the following command:

```python
python script.py
```

5. The script will prompt you to provide the necessary information:

- Enter the URL of the login page.
- Enter the username for the account you want to brute-force.
- Provide the string that occurs on the page when login fails.
  
6. The script will perform  brute-force attack and enumerate the attempted passwords. If the right password is found, it will print the username and password and exit the script.

## Important Notes :
- This script is intended for educational and ethical purposes only. Only use it on systems that you have explicit permission to test.
- Brute-force attacks are not recommended as they can be illegal and may cause harm to the target system. Use it responsibly and with caution.
- Always use strong and unique passwords to protect your online accounts.
